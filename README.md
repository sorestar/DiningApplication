## Description
### Current Stage of Development - 🥶 Closed Testing (Expected Release Date : 1 week of Feburary)

This is a dining application for students of Anyang Girls' High School / Anyang Girls' Middle School. I selected the app to target this school only, instead of making users choose their school. This was because Anyang Girls' High School is where I have learned the most, and had many memories. 

I wanted the app to feel adjusted to school-specific events, such as displaying a "Enjoy your summer break, and I'll see you all soon😺" message. 

### How I made this Application and Why

This app is a solo-developed application, with all of the elements such as the logo, UI/UX, overall app design, and programming done by myself. 

I had always wished on making an application, and started this project the moment I realized that I had the ability to make that dream into a reality. I had no prior experience in Java or android studio, but learned them on my way thanks to lots of help from stack overflow and tutorial videos. 

The app was going to be a dining application. Our school had the best lunch and dinner meals among our area, but there were no applications that had easy access to the menus. Thus, the core objective of this application was to provide a widget that displayed the lunch menu.

Overall, it was a great experience of getting to know a new programming language, and to learn a new software.
